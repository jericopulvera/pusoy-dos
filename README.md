# Pusoy Dos

> Pusoy dos (or Filipino poker, also known as chikicha or sikitcha), a variation of big two, is a popular type of "shedding" card game with origins in the islands of the Philippines in Calauag, Quezon Province. The object of the game is to be the first to discard one's hand by playing them to the table. If one cannot be first to play all cards, then the aim is to have as few cards as possible. Cards can be played separately or in certain combinations using poker hand rankings. Games of Pusoy Dos can be played by three or four people. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusoy_dos)
